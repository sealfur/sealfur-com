<!-- What does Joshua Kinal like? What music does he listen to? What films has he been watching? -->

Some words
: They’re right here on this very site, in [the section marked “Writing”](/blog).
: Older words are on [my preëxisting blog, named _Little Running Bear_](http://littlerunningbear.com/) because I used to be cute.

Some pictures
: I sometimes remember to update [my _Flickr_ photostream](https://flickr.com/photos/lrb/). When I started sharing on that site, I only had printed photos and a scanner. Uploading photos became easier over the decades, but my need to share decreased.
: There is still [an _Instagram_ account](https://www.instagram.com/sealfur/) but I don’t enjoy engaging with Meta’s services.

Toots and whatnot
: Marvel at my very [limited interaction with Mastadon](https://indieweb.social/@sealfur).

Film diaries
: I was an early adopter of _Letterboxd_ (February 2012!) but it didn’t take at the time. But now you can [see all the films I’ve watched since July 2019](https://letterboxd.com/sealfur/).

Music diaries
: I believe strongly in purchasing music and supporting artists. [My _Bandcamp_ profile](https://bandcamp.com/sealfur) shows you what I’ve bought recently and what I am keeping an ear out for.
: I don’t use music streaming services, but you can keep up to date with [what I’m listening to on _Last.fm_](https://www.last.fm/user/sealfur).
: My favourite listening still happens via what I call my “big stereo”. I love album covers and share a collection of what I’ve played recently on [my _Flickr_ “Records” album](https://flickr.com/photos/lrb/albums/72157712825444078).

Code noodling
: I mostly used [_CodePen_](https://codepen.io/sealfur/pens/popular) for a quick way to explain HTML and CSS concepts to people, but maybe I’ll build some cool stuff there too. Who knows?
