Leadership is not linked to your role or title. Just because someone said you are now “in charge” of a team or division or product does not mean you are a leader. Are you on your company’s “extended leadership team”? That does not make you a leader.

People follow a leader.

Don't conflate command and leadership. 

The bodies, collectives, groups of individuals that we call “leadership” in corporations today are mostly not that. Leadership is not risk averse.  Good leadership seeks to understand risk: anticipate it, assess it and manage it. If someone is avoiding risk entirely, than not a leader, they are a protector, removing other people's autonomy,

Corporate hierarchy is not a default leadership structure. It is a separation of responsibilities. Some roles have a more strategic view. Others are more tactical. And a few roles have to bridge the gap between them.
