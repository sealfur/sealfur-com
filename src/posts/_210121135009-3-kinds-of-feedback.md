summary: 'When giving someone a critique on their writing, think about which of these three levels of feedback best fits the scenario. What does the writer want from you? What is the most valuable kind of feedback you can give?'
draft: 'true'

There are maybe three levels of editorial feedback:

1. Conceptual feedback: Does the idea work? Does the point come across? How clear is the message?
2. Structural feedback: Are all the ideas in the right place? Is there anything missing? Most importantly, what chunks can just be removed? (Making your writing as lean as possible while still having impact is a good goal.)
3. Copy editing: Is there good sentence hierarchy in each paragraph? Which sentences can we tighten-up? Are the words in the best order to make the most impact? Which individual words can we remove? Are there any spelling, punctuation or grammatical mistakes?
