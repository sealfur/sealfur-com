“What do we need to do to make this site accessible?”

I get this question about once a week. People who aren’t familiar with it think accessibility is a binary situation: either a site is accessible or it isn’t. They often want a quick answer and there's none to be provided. Accessibility as a property of a website, is nuanced. It has a biased liminality.

Like almost all design, accessibility comes down to understanding people. When assessing digital accessibility, I find it easiest to think about who is being excluded and how:

* Who can’t access all of the content on the site?
* Are some people privileged because they have access to information others don’t?
* Is the information available to everyone, but some have to overcome needless barriers to get to it?

HTML lends itself to accessibility. If used properly, the markup language holding the web together provides all the cues needed to help someone use technology to consume the content. Sadly, most sites do not use HTML properly.

There are three roles directly responsible for making sure web pages are built properly: designers, developers and content creators. All three need to have some understanding of HTML because it’s the medium they are building on.

Imagine not understanding that pen ink adheres to paper to write a letter. Most people do not have a deep understanding of how it works, but we understand that it *does* work. We learn that as children and it becomes innate. Let’s extend this out to offset printing.

Some people (commercial printers, paper manufacturers, ink technologists) need to understand in detail how ink and paper combine and the machinery that gets the two working together. Others (graphic designers, studio managers) need to know differences between coated and uncoated paper, how almost all colour is a combination of just four inks and why bound documents are created in multiples of four (or sometimes eight). Most people just need to understand that the ink sticks to the paper, somehow, but sometimes it rubs off on your fingers (or [Silly Putty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOWPMYmT8Eo)).

They all understand that some people can’t see the printed page they’re creating. Sadly, they usually also think it’s someone else’s job to worry about that.
