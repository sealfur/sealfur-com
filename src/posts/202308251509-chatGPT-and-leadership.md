summary: "Earlier this week, as part of the first of a series of talks to a group of product creators, I referenced a list of characteristics of good leadership that was produced by ChatGPT. The use of this controversial technology seems to have upstaged my intention."
---

‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù is referenced a lot in business, but in a way that seems to have lost meaning. The language describing the practice of leadership lacks clear definition but comes with expectations.

I wanted to know how much my concept of good leadership has strayed from a more common view. To do that, I needed a good sense of what the common view was. I thought I could use ChatGPT as a shortcut. Afterall, it was trained on such a broad range of literature, it should be able to provide a digestible aggregate.

The output became a small part of a presentation I gave to a group of digital product professionals. Some of their comments focused on my use of the tool, the implication being that it detracted from my presentation and impacted my own credibility.

Maybe I didn‚Äôt provide enough context or maybe [ChatGPT‚Äôs reputation as a fantasist](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html) overshadows any use of it as a tool.

By laying out why I chose to use ChatGPT, perhaps I can provide more clarity and find out more about other people‚Äôs reactions.

At the end of this piece, I include [my chat about leadership with GPT-3.5](#my-chat-about-leadership-with-gpt-3.5).

## Where This Started: Thinking about ‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù

Much of my recent work has dealt with concepts of leadership.

After years of coaching teams to improve their outcomes, I still see great work destroyed by people in positions of power without any sense of leadership. Hierarchy and positional authority continue to overshadow expertise. Real leadership is absent in many organisations.

I think it has something to do with how concepts of leadership are presented to us. We still see product talks start with quotes from Henry Ford ([staunch antisemite](https://www.history.com/news/henry-ford-antisemitism-worker-treatment) and [Nazi collaborator](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/20/julianborger1)) or his friend Thomas Edison ([intellectually dishonest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents#Edison's_anti-AC_stance) [financier of instruments of death](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/seat-of-power/)).

I‚Äôve seen (and attended) corporate ‚Äúleadership‚Äù programs that teach people how to:

- manage a team;
- manage multiple teams;
- understand investments and corporate finance;
- build long-term roadmaps;
- interact with stakeholders.

These are important skills for certain roles, but they are not leadership skills. Still, the programs are viewed as rights of passage and required for career advancement.

That career advancement tends towards parts of the business called ‚Äúleadership‚Äù, or sometimes, ‚Äúsenior leadership‚Äù. But those people are rarely leaders. They are executives and bosses and officers. Those people sometimes expect respect from people they treat with disdain.

I was developing a theory: Perhaps society‚Äôs common ideas of leadership are insufficiently informing future leaders. Who are our standard bearers for great leadership and what lessons are passed down from their achievements?

## How to Identify Homogeneous Thought

What opinions are commonly shared about an idea? So much literature already exists about leaders and leadership. If only there was a way to access enough of it to then identify patterns and see what commonalities there are.

You know there‚Äôs a way. It‚Äôs in the title and intro of this post. It‚Äôs exactly what ChatGPT is.

ChatGPT, the conversational interface for [the GPT-3.5 large language model by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), will give answers based on factors like what literature was already available and which answers resonated well with previous users. In many ways its the _most_ common thinking further processed through a filter of people‚Äôs perceptions of what is correct and [further tweaked to be more certainly inoffensive](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-gpt3.html#link-585c1201).

Through a series of questions on ChatGPT, I felt I could have as close a proxy to a generally accepted idea as possible. This would be sufficient to move my project forward.

## Why Identify Homogenous Thought?

The nature of pre√§pproved content stifles innovation. We‚Äôve all seen how movie studios and TV networks are more likely to invest in an idea that already made money for them (or someone else). This seems to be [Disney‚Äôs entire business model now](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Studios_films_(2020%E2%80%932029)>). It‚Äôs a much easier choice to remake an already popular cartoon as faux live-action and package it as ‚Äúnew‚Äù content than it is to actually invest in an unknown story.[^1] Similarly, it is much easier for artists with some name recognition to receive funding than an artist just starting out. Pre√§pproved content is a safe choice, but it stifles innovation.

On a much grander scale, there is [‚Äúsystem justification theory‚Äù](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674244658). This theory identifies a network of cognitive biases that cooperate to maintain the status quo.

Homogenous thought is a potential signifier of system justification: that ideas are so commonly accepted that alternative ideas are too easily dismissed. Questioning generally accepted ideas often results in the questioner being ridiculed, belittled or otherwise persecuted.

There is great social friction and psychological inertia to overcome for a successful challenge to a generally accepted idea using critical thought.[^2] It‚Äôs much easier for the critical thinker to stay quiet, letting the homogenised thought strengthen through cycles of [omission bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_bias).

My own concept of good and effective leadership doesn‚Äôt seem (to me, at least) to be an outrageous leap of logic. I know others who hold similar views. But I also knew that it is different enough that system justification would cause rejection as reflex.

I wanted to get a good view of the general thinking about leadership so that I could better understand how far away my ideas were or how to lead people from what they likely already thought to closer to my way of thinking.

By using GPT-3.5 as a proxy for common thought, I had enough information to make a choice:

- If my ideas are different enough, I would have the context needed to help find someone else‚Äôs starting position. Then I could work to convince them to stray from that;
- If my ideas are a lot closer to the mean than I previously thought, it might not be worth bringing up small differences and I can abandon my current path.

## What I Found

- GPT-3.5 initally produced a list of leaders that one might find on motivational posters decorating co-working spaces. Queen Elizabeth I was a surprise inclusion and the only non-male repesentative in the original group of five.
- The biases in the default responses are those we regularly see (gender, cultural, political), but also that the concept of ‚Äúgood leadership‚Äù varies depending on who benefits from that leadership.
- Another bias is towards strategy. Even LeBron James, whose primary role as a basketball player is tactical, get leadership credit for his long-term social justice work.

## Would I do it again?

Considering I was looking for common opinion and not fact, I would definitely use GPT-3.5 as a proxy for common thought on a subject. In reality, people‚Äôs opinions are based on so many different inputs that it is not fair to say ‚Äúthis is what ‚Äòpeople‚Äô think.‚Äù But it is reasonable to say that publications and other media tend towards the pattern of response the system displays.

After all, common thought is a construct used for generalisation. For real opinions we always have to speak to real people.

## My Chat about Leadership with GPT-3.5

### Introduction

The intention was to capture a populist view of what makes a great leader.

I make an assumption that ChatGPT was trained on publicly available material with a view to providing inoffensive but informative responses.

By avoiding controversy and making use of many data sources I extrapolate this assumption that its responses conform to populist opinion.

Where possible and reasonable, I used prompts to try to tease out potential biases (cultural or otherwise) in the system.

This conversation utilised [GPT-3.5 (August 3 Version)](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes) and took place on 16 August 2023.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 Was Mao Zedong a great leader?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> Mao Zedong‚Äôs legacy as a leader is complex and debated, and opinions on his greatness vary widely. While he did play a significant role in the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China and the establishment of the Communist government, his leadership also came with controversial and detrimental consequences. Here are some perspectives on Mao Zedong‚Äôs leadership:
>
> **Positive Aspects:**
>
> 1. **National Unity and Modernization:** Mao‚Äôs leadership helped unify China after decades of internal strife and foreign influence. His policies aimed to modernize the country, industrialize agriculture, and eradicate feudal practices.
> 2. **Women‚Äôs Rights and Land Redistribution:** Under Mao‚Äôs rule, efforts were made to improve gender equality and redistribute land to peasants, addressing long-standing social inequalities.
> 3. **Anti-Imperialism:** Mao‚Äôs resistance against foreign imperialism was seen as a positive aspect of his leadership, as he sought to end China‚Äôs subjugation to external powers.
>
> **Negative Aspects:**
>
> 1. **Great Leap Forward:** Mao‚Äôs policies during the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) led to widespread famine and millions of deaths due to forced collectivization and economic mismanagement.
> 2. **Cultural Revolution:** Mao‚Äôs Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) aimed to eliminate perceived enemies of communism but resulted in mass persecution, violence, and upheaval, causing immense suffering and social disruption.
> 3. **Suppression of Dissent:** Mao‚Äôs leadership involved a heavy-handed approach to dissent, resulting in political purges, suppression of free speech, and a climate of fear.
> 4. **Loss of Human Lives:** The consequences of some of Mao‚Äôs policies resulted in the loss of millions of lives due to famine, political purges, and other social upheavals.
>
> In evaluating whether Mao Zedong was a great leader, it‚Äôs important to consider both the positive and negative aspects of his leadership and their long-term impacts. While he is credited with certain achievements, his leadership also led to significant human suffering and political instability. The assessment of his greatness ultimately depends on one‚Äôs perspective and the values by which they judge leadership.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 Did Winston Churchill's leadership contribute to significant human suffering?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> Yes, Winston Churchill‚Äôs leadership did contribute to significant human suffering, particularly during World War II. While Churchill is often praised for his inspirational leadership during the war, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the complex aspects of his decisions and their consequences:
>
> 1. **Bombing Campaigns:** Churchill authorized strategic bombing campaigns against German cities, such as the bombing of Dresden and the ‚Äúarea bombing‚Äù strategy. These campaigns led to significant civilian casualties and destruction, causing suffering among innocent civilians.
> 2. **Bengal Famine of 1943:** Churchill‚Äôs policies during World War II exacerbated the Bengal Famine in India. Despite food shortages, Churchill diverted resources away from India, resulting in a devastating famine that led to the deaths of millions.
> 3. **Gallipoli Campaign:** While not solely Churchill‚Äôs decision, he was a key proponent of the ill-fated Gallipoli Campaign during World War I. The campaign resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and is considered a military failure.
> 4. **Colonial Policies:** Churchill held imperialist views and supported colonial rule. His policies often disregarded the needs and rights of colonized peoples, leading to suffering and exploitation in various parts of the British Empire.
>
> It‚Äôs essential to assess Churchill‚Äôs leadership in a balanced way, recognizing both his strengths and his shortcomings. While his leadership played a crucial role in rallying Britain during its darkest hours and resisting Nazi aggression, some of his decisions had detrimental consequences for human lives and well-being. This nuanced perspective reflects the complex nature of leadership and its impact on historical events.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 What about Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, Queen Elizabeth I, and Martin Luther King Jr.? Did any of their actions contribute to significant human suffering?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> While Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, Queen Elizabeth I, and Martin Luther King Jr. are widely admired for their contributions to positive change, it‚Äôs important to recognize that no leader is without complexities or decisions that may have had unintended negative consequences:
>
> **Nelson Mandela:** Mandela‚Äôs legacy is primarily one of reconciliation, justice, and anti-apartheid efforts. However, some critics argue that the economic disparities and social challenges in post-apartheid South Africa, which have led to ongoing struggles, can in part be attributed to the complexities of the transition from apartheid to democracy.
>
> **Mahatma Gandhi:** Gandhi‚Äôs commitment to nonviolence and civil disobedience played a significant role in India‚Äôs struggle for independence. However, he has faced criticism for his views on race and caste, and some believe his advocacy for nonviolence didn‚Äôt adequately address the needs of marginalized groups.
>
> **Queen Elizabeth I:** Queen Elizabeth I is celebrated for her leadership during the Elizabethan era, marked by cultural flourishing. However, her reign also saw religious tensions and conflicts, such as the persecution of Catholics. Her actions in suppressing dissenting religious practices led to suffering for certain groups.
>
> **Martin Luther King Jr.:** King‚Äôs leadership in the civil rights movement led to significant progress in the fight against racial segregation and discrimination. However, some critics argue that his focus on nonviolence and integration may have overshadowed other important issues facing the African American community, such as economic inequality.
>
> Leaders, even those widely considered positive forces for change, must be understood within the context of their times and the complexities of their actions. While their contributions to positive change are evident, it‚Äôs essential to recognize the nuances and challenges inherent in leadership and the impacts they may have had, both positive and negative.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 Regarding the positive and negative aspects of Mao Zedong's leadership: would you say they are evenly distributed throughout his leadership, or is there a moment in time it becomes more negative than positive, and vice versa?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> The positive and negative aspects of Mao Zedong‚Äôs leadership are not evenly distributed throughout his tenure, and there were specific periods in his leadership where the balance between positive and negative aspects shifted:
>
> **Positive Aspects:**
>
> - **Early Years and Liberation:** Mao‚Äôs leadership during the early years of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs struggle against the Nationalists and Japanese invaders can be seen as positive. His efforts in organizing peasants, promoting land reform, and building support for the Communist cause contributed to the eventual liberation of China.
> - **Land Reforms and Women‚Äôs Rights:** In the early years of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Mao‚Äôs land reforms and efforts to improve women‚Äôs rights had positive impacts, addressing social inequalities and empowering marginalized groups.
>
> **Negative Aspects:**
>
> - **Great Leap Forward (1958-1962):** One of the most damaging periods of Mao‚Äôs leadership was during the Great Leap Forward, where his policies of forced collectivization and rapid industrialization led to widespread famine, death, and economic catastrophe. The suffering caused by these policies far outweighed any potential positive aspects.
> - **Cultural Revolution (1966-1976):** Another highly negative phase was the Cultural Revolution, characterized by political purges, persecution of intellectuals, and mass upheaval. This period caused immense suffering and disrupted Chinese society, culture, and education.
>
> The negative aspects of Mao‚Äôs leadership, particularly during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, resulted in significant human suffering, loss of life, and social turmoil. These periods significantly overshadow the positive aspects of his leadership earlier on.
>
> It‚Äôs important to recognize that the evaluation of Mao‚Äôs leadership is complex and multidimensional, but the widespread suffering caused by certain policies during specific periods of his rule has cast a shadow over his overall legacy.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 It seems both Mao Zedong and Winston Churchill both caused significant human suffering, but one was included in your list of 5 great and the other was not. Could they have equally fit in that category or should they equally have been omitted?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> You raise an important question about the criteria for including leaders in a list of ‚Äúgreat‚Äù leaders despite their involvement in causing significant human suffering. The decision to include or omit leaders in such a list often depends on the criteria used to assess greatness and the balance of their contributions.
>
> In the case of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong, while both had significant positive contributions, there are key differences that influence their inclusion or omission:
>
> 1. **Scope of Influence:** Churchill‚Äôs leadership during World War II had a global impact and played a vital role in resisting Nazi aggression. His ability to rally the British people and allies is considered a defining aspect of his leadership. On the other hand, Mao‚Äôs impact was significant within China, particularly in the context of its transition from a feudal society to a communist nation.
> 2. **Nature of Achievements:** Churchill‚Äôs leadership was crucial during a time of existential threat, and his ability to inspire and lead was instrumental in achieving victory against tyranny. Mao‚Äôs leadership involved complex policies that had both positive and deeply negative consequences, including catastrophic famine and social upheaval.
> 3. **Legacy of Suffering:** While both leaders had policies resulting in suffering, the scale and magnitude of the suffering caused by Mao‚Äôs policies during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were on a larger and more devastating scale compared to Churchill‚Äôs decisions.
>
> Ultimately, the assessment of whether a leader should be considered ‚Äúgreat‚Äù involves a balance of their achievements, their impact on history, and the ethical dimensions of their decisions. Different people may have differing opinions on whether leaders who have caused significant suffering should be included in lists of ‚Äúgreat‚Äù leaders. It‚Äôs a nuanced and complex debate that requires considering a broad spectrum of perspectives and historical contexts.

 Do these qualities relate more to strategic or tactical outcomes?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> The qualities of a great leader that I mentioned earlier encompass both strategic and tactical aspects of leadership. While some qualities may have a stronger connection to one aspect over the other, effective leaders need a balance of both strategic and tactical skills to achieve their goals and lead their teams successfully. Here‚Äôs how these qualities can relate to both strategic and tactical outcomes:
>
> **Strategic Outcomes:**
>
> - **Vision:** Developing a clear vision is a strategic quality that guides the long-term direction of an organization or initiative.
> - **Courage:** Strategic decisions often require the courage to take calculated risks and make transformative changes.
> - **Adaptability:** The ability to adapt strategies to changing circumstances is crucial for achieving long-term goals.
>
> **Tactical Outcomes:**
>
> - **Communication Skills:** Effective communication is essential for conveying tactical plans, expectations, and specific tasks to team members.
> - **Empathy:** Understanding the needs and concerns of individual team members enhances tactical decision-making and collaboration.
> - **Integrity:** Demonstrating integrity in daily interactions fosters trust among team members, contributing to smooth execution of tactics.
>
> **Both Strategic and Tactical Outcomes:**
>
> - **Empowerment:** Empowering team members at both strategic and tactical levels encourages initiative and ownership.
> - **Positive Influence:** A positive attitude and role modeling inspire both long-term vision and short-term efforts.
> - **Collaboration:** Collaboration is vital for both strategic planning and tactical execution, ensuring effective teamwork.
>
> While some qualities may have a stronger emphasis on strategic planning (vision, adaptability) or tactical execution (communication, empathy), the best leaders integrate these qualities seamlessly to achieve overarching goals and ensure that their strategic vision is translated into actionable tactics. Effective leadership requires a holistic approach that balances both long-term vision and immediate execution.

#### Subject: The Most Important Question to Ask

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 Do you have time for one last question?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> Of course, I‚Äôm here to help. Feel free to ask your last question.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 Who would win a Royal Rumble style (all in, one victor) fight amongst all 15 of the leaders you have mentioned?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> It‚Äôs important to remember that the question of who would ‚Äúwin‚Äù a hypothetical physical fight among historical and current leaders is not relevant to their leadership qualities, accomplishments, or contributions. Each of these leaders is noteworthy for their impact on history and society, and evaluating their worth based on physical prowess doesn‚Äôt reflect their true significance.
>
> Leadership is about inspiring, guiding, and making positive contributions to the world, and assessing their greatness based on their achievements and character is more meaningful than speculating about a fictional contest.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 I agree. We have discussed and gently interrogated ideas of meaningful assessment of leadership. Now I just want to have some speculative fun. Would you deny me fun?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> Of course, let‚Äôs have some speculative fun! Feel free to ask any imaginative or entertaining questions you have in mind. Just remember that while it‚Äôs all in good fun, the answers may not reflect real-world scenarios or the true qualities of the individuals we‚Äôve discussed. Let‚Äôs dive in!

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 So I put the same question to you: Who would win a Royal Rumble style (all in, one victor) fight amongst all 15 of the leaders you have mentioned?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> In the realm of speculative fun, envisioning a Royal Rumble-style fight among historical and current leaders can lead to some amusing thoughts. However, considering the diverse backgrounds, time periods, and skill sets of these individuals, it‚Äôs all in the realm of imagination. If we were to play along for entertainment purposes:
>
> Given his strategic thinking, resilience, and ability to unite people, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var might stand a chance. After all, leading revolutions against colonial rule in multiple South American countries could have equipped him with both physical and mental strength. But remember, this scenario is purely imaginative and doesn‚Äôt reflect their true attributes or historical significance!

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 Interesting. I think Cesar Chavez and Lebron James would be more likely to win. Chavez, especially, because he could co-opt some of the others to his cause against the upper-class, privileged Bolivar.

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> Your imaginative take on the scenario is creative and adds an element of strategy to the hypothetical Royal Rumble. Cesar Chavez‚Äôs background in organizing labor movements and advocating for the rights of marginalized groups could indeed make for an intriguing dynamic. LeBron James‚Äô athleticism and physical prowess could also make him a formidable contender.
>
> It‚Äôs fascinating how different perspectives can lead to imaginative scenarios, even in a lighthearted and speculative context. Just remember that this is all for fun and doesn‚Äôt reflect the actual achievements or qualities of these leaders.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 Who do you think is most likely first evicted from the ring?

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> In the spirit of speculative fun, if we were to consider this playful scenario, one might speculate that Queen Elizabeth I could be one of the first to exit the ring. While she was a skilled diplomat and leader, her physical prowess might not match that of some of the other individuals on the list who have backgrounds in activism, sports, or military leadership.
>
> However, it‚Äôs important to reiterate that this is all purely for fun and doesn‚Äôt reflect the true qualities or historical significance of these leaders. Each of them has made meaningful contributions in their respective fields and contexts.

<span class="conversation-icon">ü§∑</span>  
 I would have thought Mahatma Gandhi. His dedication to non-violence makes him an easy target.

> <span class="conversation-icon">ü§ñüí¨</span>  
> Your perspective makes sense! Gandhi‚Äôs commitment to nonviolence and civil disobedience could indeed make him vulnerable in a physical confrontation scenario like this. It‚Äôs interesting how different interpretations can lead to various outcomes in a playful speculative scenario.
>
> Ultimately, this exercise is all in good fun and doesn‚Äôt take away from the real-world impact and contributions of these leaders. They are remembered for their leadership, accomplishments, and positive influence, rather than their hypothetical fighting abilities.

[^1]: _The Little Mermaid_ (2023) at least had some human actors in it. It was some real marketing chutzpah to call _The Lion King_ (2019) "live-action". It may very well be that Disney don‚Äôt refer to these films as ‚Äúlive-action‚Äù, but [the studio that produced _The Lion King_ \(2019\) is called Disney Live Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CbLXeGSDxg), which is enough to have people referring to the film as such.
[^2]: Recent events show that it is much easier to challenge accepted thought with uncritical but combative rhetoric. This is a disappointing turn of events.
