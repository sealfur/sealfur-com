  > ‘In short,’ continued M, ‘we suspect that this Jamaican treasure is being used to finance the Soviet espionage system, or an important part of it, in America. And our suspicion becomes a certainty when I tell you who this Mr. Big is.’

I'd never before clocked the desperate clinging to an empire already fallen. This James Bond novel is a reminder of how far we've come and how long it's taken to get here.

Filled with abject racism to put the Tintin stories to shame, I had to put the book down early and it took me months to build the stomach to pick it back up.

What surprises me is how often in these novels James Bond is captured. His success as a spy is related more to his ability to kill his way out of a situation than through any intelligence or wit. His talents are in physical ability and perseverance to succeed.

Enough has been written about the character's attitude towards women, sex and intimacy, that I don't need to cover it here. A man who smokes 60 cigarettes a day and drinks martinis or whisky at the volume Bond seems to, must hate himself to extraordinary depths.

Bond's value to the reader is in exploring his continued attempts to die, contrasting with his training for survival.

Fleming, on the other hand, is a fascist's dream author. He celebrates the victories of the past while acknowledging a future he wants no part of. His villains speak of a changing world and his heroes do everything they can to stop that future from happening.

In *Live and Let Die*, Fleming focus Bond more on trying to understand the nature of sharks and barracudas than the plight of humans with differing physical appearance. And therein lies the intention of the author: he places the white British man as his default model for "humanity", refusing to learn the lessons of an empire already lost and the long-term destruction it caused. His hero succeeds through gunpowder, ballistics and underwater hunting tools: inventions of people the author looks down upon, unable to even grant them the dignity of equality.
