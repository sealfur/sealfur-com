Being a consultant meant I continually had to explain what I do and why my client should spend money on my skills.

It’s a tough thing to do. My work rarely fits into the buzzword labels used as shortcuts for invoice line-items. Because of that, most of my work spawned from word-of-mouth or clients leaving one organisation, starting at another and hiring our firm again.

Over the years I tried to make my work a lot more visible to give people a better understanding of what I do. That also helps me articulate it and make its benefits more recognisable to my clients.

To improve <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshkinal/" rel="me">my *LinkedIn* profile</a> and be ready for new opportunities, I had to think about why clients sometimes fought to keep me on their projects. It helps that I maintained a record of client feedback that I could draw on. I combined that with the language I developed over time (and continue to develop).

This is what I came up with for my *LinkedIn* ‘About’ section. Any [feedback you could provide me](https://indieweb.social/@sealfur) would help a lot.

> I am a design engineer with a diverse background: biomedical science, journalism and broadcasting, digital product design and development. My work focuses on how digital products impact the world; from the way they are constructed to the way they are used. Good products, built smartly can improve lives as well as profit margins.

> Over the last few years I was in-demand as a product methodologies coach for delivery teams, their POs and stakeholders to ASX100 companies and some of Australia’s largest technology providers. I establish attitude changes through deliberate practice, resulting in teams achieving better results without requiring more investment.
