Honestly, I don’t know how “not ugly” these are anymore. But I found three worth checking out.

## Allure LED Table Lamp

The [Allure LED Table Lamp](https://lights4less.com.au/products/allure-led-table-lamp-touch-3000k-black-gold-allure-tl-bk-gd) looks pretty simple and stylish. It’s more expensive than the others, though. Maybe there’s a reason?

## Espen Touch Table Lamp Gunmetal

There are a couple that are like this. [The Espen Lamp](https://lights4less.com.au/products/espen-touch-table-lamp-gunmetal-lf9207gm) is inoffensive at best. I’m sure they’re a simple choice for an airbnb

## Lotti Table Lamp Touch

[The Lotti](https://lights4less.com.au/products/lotti-table-lamp-touch-gunmetal-metal-lf9201gm?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&pr_rec_id=6a92f037b&pr_rec_pid=6556854681751&pr_ref_pid=7214265139351&pr_seq=uniform) is a similar situation to the Espen. I'm sure we can do better than these.
