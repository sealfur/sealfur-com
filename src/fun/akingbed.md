## The Space We Can Work with

Our Bedroom (roughly)  
: 3060mm × 3150mm

Currently we have the following clear space on either side:

| Window side (cm) | Wardrobe side (cm) | Total (cm) |
| :--------------: | :----------------: | :--------: |
|        54        |         76         |    130     |

### King Size Bed

| Mattress size | Width × Length (cm) | Minimum room size (cm) |
| ------------- | :-----------------: | :--------------------: |
| King          |     183.5 × 203     |       366 × 366        |

So, difference between Queen and King is 31cm. We lose 15.5cm on each side.

Moving to a king size bed in that room would bring us down to less than 1 metre of clear space. (only 99cm). Bedside tables could only be 45cm wide. They exist and they’re not hideous.s
