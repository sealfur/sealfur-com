My intention was to make it [an 11ty site](https://www.11ty.dev/) so that I can blog using markdown and git alone. Also, I want to build a repository of resources about certain topics to refer people to when they ask me questions.

Currently, there’s just some of [my recent writing](/blog). If I wrote more consistently, you could call it a blog.

Check out some of the topics I tackle:

* [Accessibility](/tag/accessibility)
* [Build in public](/tag/build-in-public/) and
* [Continuous improvement](/tag/continuous-improvement/)

There’s more to come. I’ll mention new things on the [Updates section](#updates) on this page.
