# Screenshot of the Horrific UI Design That Led Citigroup to Accidentally Send $893 Million  - Core77
When they realized their mistake, they tried to get the money back. Some of the lenders refused, leaving Citigroup out of roughly $500 million. The case went to trial, and [this week U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan ruled against Citigroup](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-citigroup-revlon-lawsuit/citigroup-cannot-recoup-revlon-payouts-after-nearly-900-million-gaffe-u-s-judge-idUSKBN2AG1TJ).

How could an error like this possibly happen? Terrible, terrible UI design, as it turns out.
