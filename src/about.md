I'll write something about myself here, including: My previous website was called [_Little Running Bear_](https://littlerunningbear.com) and it was built on WordPress[^1]. It's still there but I stopped writing on it.

This page should probably also contain colophon info. Therefore:

## Colophon

This version of the website, _Sealfur_, was created in late 2020, and built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). 

### Fonts
The display font is [Sansita Swashed from Omnibus-Type](https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/sansita-swashed/) and the body copy is in [Inter by Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/inter/) (without any of the fancy features turned on yet).


[^1]: WordPress is a very good content management system and I highly recommend it. It was much more than I need but you could do a lot worse than use WordPress for your own website.
