<!-- Find information about designer, writer, broadcaster, podcaster and eternal dilettante, Joshua Kinal. -->

sealfur.com (this website) is a chance to play around with some HTML and CSS, post some things that interest me and maybe even find a way to engage with others.

## About the author

### tl;dr

Joshua Kinal is a design engineer with a diverse background: biomedical
science, journalism and broadcasting, digital product design and
development. His work focuses on how digital products impact the world;
from the way they are constructed to the way they are used.

### First-person, approachable version

_Am I a polymath, or is that considered an arrogant self-declaration?_

I have been a designer, writer, journalist, scientist, broadcaster, podcaster and developer.

I worked in television, radio, design studios, universities, print media, start-ups and consultancies.

My previous website was called [_Little Running Bear_](https://littlerunningbear.com) and it was built on WordPress[^1]. It's still there but I stopped writing on it. I say "my previous website", but like so many web tinkerers, I have little bits of myself all over the web.

sealfur.com exists to move my web-content practice towards having a lot more control over what I produce and how it is rendered in browsers.

Often, before committing an idea onto this site, [I’ll fumble around on CodePen](https://codepen.io/sealfur). I also use it as a quick way to explain a web-based concept to someone. It’s very handy.

## Principals for this site

I believe that principles guide actions and actions reveal principles. The principles I list here are a reminder to me (and maybe a nudge for you). I hope that my actions do not contradict what I call out as important to me.

1. [<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 AA+](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) accessibility
2. [Rule of least power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html) (described by Tim Berners-Lee and Noah Mendelsohn)[^1]
3. Function over form
4. Keep learning
5. Low barrier to contribution
6. Build in public

## Colophon

This version of the website (_Sealfur_) was first created in late 2020, and built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). 

This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which, if I've set this up correctly, will automatically build the site when I push changes to my git repository.

### Fonts
The display font is [Sansita Swashed from Omnibus-Type](https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/sansita-swashed/) and the body copy is in [Inter by Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/inter/) (with many of the [fancy features](https://rsms.me/inter/#features) turned on, because I can).


[^1]: WordPress is a very good content management system and I highly recommend it. It was much more than I need but you could do a lot worse than use WordPress for your own website.
